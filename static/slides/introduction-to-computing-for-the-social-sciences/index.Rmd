# The results

```{r, echo = FALSE, out.height = "70%", out.width = "70%", fig.width = 6}
knitr::include_graphics(path = "https://i.imgflip.com/1szkun.jpg")
```

---

# Automation

* Jane forgets how she transformed and analyzed the data
    * Extension of analysis will fall flat
* Sally uses *automation*
    * Re-run programs
    * No mistakes
    * Much easier to implement *in the long run*

---

# Reproducibility

* Are my results valid? Can it be *replicated*?
* The idea that data analyses, and more generally, scientific claims, are published with their data and software code so that others may verify the findings and build upon them
* Also allows the researcher to precisely replicate his/her analysis

---

# Version control

* Revisions in research
* Tracking revisions
* Multiple copies
    * `analysis-1.r`
    * `analysis-2.r`
    * `analysis-3.r`
* Cloud storage (e.g. Dropbox, Google Drive, Box)
* Version control software
    * Repository

# Documentation

* *Comments* are the what
* *Code* is the how
* Computer code should also be *self-documenting*
* Future-proofing

# Badly documented code

```{r sesame-bad, eval = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)
tmls <- get_timeline(c("MeCookieMonster", "Grover", "elmo", "CountVonCount"), 3000)
ts_plot(group_by(tmls, screen_name), "weeks")
```

---

# Good code

```{r sesame-good, eval = FALSE}
# get_to_sesame_street.R
# Program to retrieve recent tweets from Sesame Street characters

# load packages for data management and Twitter API
library(tidyverse)
library(rtweet)

# retrieve most recent 3000 tweets of Sesame Street characters
tmls <- get_timeline(
  user = c("MeCookieMonster", "Grover", "elmo", "CountVonCount"),
  n = 3000
)

# group by character and plot weekly tweet frequency
tmls %>%
  group_by(screen_name) %>%
  ts_plot(by = "weeks")
