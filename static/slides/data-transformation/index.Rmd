### What is the average body mass of an Adelie penguin?

1. First we need to identify the **input**, or the data we're going to analyze.
1. Next we need to **select** only the observations which are Adelie penguins.
1. Finally we need to calculate the average value, or **mean**, of `body_mass_g`.

# `penguins`

### What is the average body mass of an Adelie penguin?

```{r avg-mass}
data("penguins")
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie")
summarize(.data = penguins_adelie, avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

# `penguins`

### What is the average body mass of a penguin for each species?

--

```{r by-species}
data("penguins")
penguins_species <- group_by(.data = penguins, species)
summarize(.data = penguins_species, avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### What is the average bill length and body mass for each Adelie penguin by sex?

```{r adelie-by-sex}
data("penguins")
penguins_adelie <- filter(.data = penguins, species == "Adelie")
penguins_adelie_sex <- group_by(.data = penguins_adelie, sex)
summarize(
  .data = penguins_adelie_sex,
  bill = mean(bill_length_mm, na.rm = TRUE),
  avg_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE)
)
```

# Verbiage for data transformation

1. The first argument is a data frame
1. Subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame
1. The result is a new data frame

---

# Key functions in `dplyr`

`function()`  | Action performed
--------------|--------------------------------------------------------
`filter()`    | Subsets observations based on their values
`arrange()`   | Changes the order of observations based on their values
`select()`    | Selects a subset of columns from the data frame
`rename()`    | Changes the name of columns in the data frame
`mutate()`    | Creates new columns (or variables)
`group_by()`  | Changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups
`summarize()` | Collapses the data frame to a smaller number of rows which summarize the larger data
