# `diamonds`

### What is the average price of an ideal cut diamond?

1. Identify the *input*
1. *Select* only the observations which are ideal cut diamonds
1. Calculate the average value, or *mean*, of price

### What is the average price of an ideal cut diamond?

# Verbiage for data transformation

1. The first argument is a data frame
1. Subsequent arguments describe what to do with the data frame
1. The result is a new data frame

---

# Key functions in `dplyr`

`function()`  | Action performed
--------------|--------------------------------------------------------
`filter()`    | Subsets observations based on their values
`arrange()`   | Changes the order of observations based on their values
`select()`    | Selects a subset of columns from the data frame
`rename()`    | Changes the name of columns in the data frame
`mutate()`    | Creates new columns (or variables)
`group_by()`  | Changes the unit of analysis from the complete dataset to individual groups
`summarize()` | Collapses the data frame to a smaller number of rows which summarize the larger data
