# Bugs

> An error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways.

* Computers are powerful tools that are incredibly stupid
* Debugging has two goals:
    * Fix bugs once they occur
    * Prevent bugs from occurring in the first place

# Defensive programming

* Style guide
* Failing fast

class: small

We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.

And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them....

The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

# Debugging techniques

1. Realize that you have a bug
1. Make it repeatable
1. Figure out where it is
1. Fix it and test it

---

# The call stack

```{r callstack, error = TRUE}
f <- function(a) g(a)
g <- function(b) h(b)
h <- function(c) i(c)
i <- function(d) "a" + d
f(10)
```

```{r traceback, eval = FALSE}
traceback()
```

```
# 4: i(c) at exceptions-example.R#3
# 3: h(b) at exceptions-example.R#2
# 2: g(a) at exceptions-example.R#1
# 1: f(10)
```

---

# Condition handling

* Unexpected errors
* Expected errors
* `safely()`

---

# Dealing with failure using `safely()`

* Adverb
* Always returns a list with two elements
    1. `result`
    1. `error`

---

# Dealing with failure using `safely()`

```{r sqrt_safely}
safe_sqrt <- safely(sqrt)
str(safe_sqrt(9))
str(safe_sqrt("a"))
```

---

# `safely()` and `map()`

```{r safely_map, error = TRUE, collapse = TRUE}
x <- list("a", 4, 5)

# unsafely square root
y <- map(x, sqrt)

# safely log
y <- map(x, safely(sqrt))
str(y)
```

---

# `transpose()`

```{r transpose}
y <- transpose(y)
str(y)
```

---

# Extract the values of `x` where `y` is an error

```{r error_x, collapse = TRUE}
y$error

(is_ok <- y$error %>%
    map_lgl(is_null))

x[!is_ok]
```

---

# Extract the values of `y` that are ok

```{r okay_y}
y$result[is_ok] %>%
  flatten_dbl()
```

---

# `possibly()`

```{r possibly}
map_dbl(x, possibly(sqrt, NA))
```

---
