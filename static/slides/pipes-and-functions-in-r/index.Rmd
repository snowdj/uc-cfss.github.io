> Using the `diamonds` dataset, calculate the average price for each cut of "I" colored diamonds.

1. Filter `diamonds` to only keep observations where the color is rated as "I"
1. Group the filtered `diamonds` data frame by cut
1. Summarize the grouped and filtered `diamonds` data frame by calculating the average price

# Intermediate steps

```{r intermediate}
diamonds_1 <- filter(diamonds, color == "I")
diamonds_2 <- group_by(diamonds_1, cut)
(diamonds_3 <- summarize(diamonds_2, price = mean(price)))
```

---

# Overwrite the original

```{r overwrite}
# copy diamonds to diamonds_t just for demonstration purposes
diamonds_t <- diamonds

diamonds_t <- filter(diamonds_t, color == "I")
diamonds_t <- group_by(diamonds_t, cut)
(diamonds_t <- summarize(diamonds_t, price = mean(price)))
```

# Function composition

```{r function_comp}

    filter(diamonds, color == "I"),
    cut
  ),
  price = mean(price)
)
```

# Function composition

```{r function-comp-single}
summarize(group_by(filter(diamonds, color == "I"), cut), price = mean(price))

# Piping

```{r pipe}

# Functions

* Easy to reuse
* Self-documenting
* Easy-ier to debug
* [If you have copied and pasted a block of code more than twice, convert it to a function.](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#when-should-you-write-a-function)

# Function components

* Name
* Arguments

# Rescale function

```{r, collapse = TRUE}
rescale01 <- function(x) {
  rng <- range(x, na.rm = TRUE)
  (x - rng[1]) / (rng[2] - rng[1])
}

rescale01(c(0, 5, 10))
rescale01(c(-10, 0, 10))
rescale01(c(1, 2, 3, NA, 5))
```

# What is that?

```{r}
pythagorean <- function(a, b){
  hypotenuse <- sqrt(a^2 + b^2)
  return(hypotenuse)
}
```

* Name
* Arguments
* Body

# How to use a function

```{r error = TRUE}
# print the output of the function
pythagorean(a = 3, b = 4)

# save the output as a new object
(tri_c <- pythagorean(a = 3, b = 4))

# what happens to the hypotenuse from inside the function?
pythagorean(a = 3, b = 4)
hypotenuse
```
