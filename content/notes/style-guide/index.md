![Admiral Grace Hopper discovered the first bug in a computer](/img/grace-hopper.jpg)

A **software bug** is "an error, flaw, failure or fault in a computer program or system that causes it to produce an incorrect or unexpected result, or to behave in unintended ways."^[Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_bug)] In an ideal world, the computer will warn you when it encounters a bug. R has the ability to do this in some situations (see our discussion below of errors, warnings, and messages). However bugs also arise because you expect the program to do one thing but provide it the ability to perform different from expectations.

As I have repeatedly emphasized in class, **computers are powerful tools that are incredibly stupid**. They will do exactly what you tell them to, nothing more and nothing less. If you write your code in a way that allows it to behave in an unintended way, this is your fault. The first goal of debugging should be to prevent unintended behaviors before they strike. However, when such bugs occur we need the tools and knowledge to track down these unintended behaviors and correct them in our code.

The most important step to debugging is to prevent bugs in the first place. There are several methods we can employ to do that. Some of them are simple such as styling our code so that we follow consistent practices when writing scripts and programs. Consistency will prevent silly and minor mistakes such as typos. Good styles also make our code more **readable** for the human eye and allow us to isolate and detect errors merely by looking at the screen. Others are more advanced and focus on the concept of **failing fast** - as soon as something goes wrong, stop executing the program and announce an error.

## Writing code

Think back to [the analogy of programming languages to human languages](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/setup00.html#introduction). Programming languages adhere to a specific grammar and syntax, they contain a vocabulary, etymology, cultural conventions, word roots (prefixes and suffixes), just like English or any other written or spoken language. We can therefore equate different components of a program to their language counterparts:

Programming |	Language
------------|----------
Scripts |	Essays
Sections | Paragraphs
Lines Breaks | Sentences
Parentheses |	Punctuation
Functions |	Verbs
Variables |	Nouns

Now think about how you write a document in English. In 1987, [the Challenger space shuttle exploded just 73 seconds after takeoff](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Shuttle_Challenger_disaster). The deaths of seven crewmembers were seen live by millions of American schoolchildren watching around the country. A few hours after the tragedy, President Ronald Reagan gave a national address.

Here is an excerpt of that address:

> weve grown used to wonders in this century its hard to dazzle us but for 25 years the united states space program has been doing just that weve grown used to the idea of space and perhaps we forget that weve only just begun were still pioneers they the members of the Challenger crew were pioneers and i want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttles takeoff i know it is hard to understand but sometimes painful things like this happen its all part of the process of exploration and discovery its all part of taking a chance and expanding mans horizons the future doesnt belong to the fainthearted it belongs to the brave the challenger crew was pulling us into the future and well continue to follow them the crew of the space shuttle challenger honored us by the manner in which they lived their lives we will never forget them nor the last time we saw them this morning as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and slipped the surly bonds of earth to touch the face of god

Wait a minute, this doesn't look right. What happened to the punctuation? The capitalization? Where are all the sentences and paragraph breaks? Isn't this hard to read and understand? Do you feel any of the emotions of the moment? Probably not, because the normal rules of grammar and syntax have been destroyed. Here's the same excerpt, but properly styled:

> We've grown used to wonders in this century. It's hard to dazzle us. But for 25 years the United States space program has been doing just that. We've grown used to the idea of space, and perhaps we forget that we've only just begun. We're still pioneers. They, the members of the Challenger crew, were pioneers.
> 
> And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it is hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the fainthearted; it belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future, and we'll continue to follow them....
> 
> The crew of the space shuttle Challenger honoured us by the manner in which they lived their lives. We will never forget them, nor the last time we saw them, this morning, as they prepared for the journey and waved goodbye and 'slipped the surly bonds of earth' to 'touch the face of God.'

That makes much more sense. Adhering to standard rules of style make the text more legible and interpretable. This is what we should aim for when writing programs in R.^[And for that matter, in any other programming language as well. Note however that these style rules are specific to R; other languages by necessity may use different rules and conventions.]

## Style guide

Here are some common rules you should adopt when writing code in R, adapted from Hadley Wickham's [style guide](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Style.html).

## Notation and naming

### File names

Files should have intuitive and meaningful names. Avoid spaces or non-standard characters in your file names. R scripts should always end in `.R`; R Markdown documents should always end in `.Rmd`.

```r
# Good
fit-models.R
utility-functions.R
gun-deaths.Rmd

# Bad
foo.r
stuff.r
gun deaths.rmd
```

### Object names

Variables refer to data objects such as vectors, lists, or data frames. Variable and function names should be lowercase. Use an underscore (`_`) to separate words within a name. Avoid using periods (`.`).^[These are useful for writing functions for [generic methods](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/OO-essentials.html).] Variable names should generally be nouns and function names should be verbs. Try to pick names that are concise and meaningful.

```r
# Good
day_one
day_1

# Bad
first_day_of_the_month
DayOne
dayone
djm1
```

Where possible, avoid using names of existing functions and variables. Doing so will cause confusion for the readers of your code, not to mention make it difficult to access the existing functions and variables.

```r
# Bad
T <- FALSE
c <- 10
```

For instance, what would happen if I created a new `mean()` function?


```r
x <- seq(from = 1, to = 10)
mean(x)
```

```
## [1] 5.5
```

```r
# create new mean function
mean <- function(x) sum(x)
mean(x)
```

```
[1] 55
```

![](https://i.giphy.com/BxWTWalKTUAdq.gif)

## Syntax

### Spacing

Place spaces around all [infix](https://www.programiz.com/r-programming/infix-operator) operators (=, +, -, <-, etc.). The same rule applies when using `=` in function calls.

{{% callout note %}}

Always put a space after a comma, and never before (just like in regular English).

{{% /callout %}}

```r
# Good
average <- mean(feet / 12 + inches, na.rm = TRUE)

# Bad
average<-mean(feet/12+inches,na.rm=TRUE)
```

Place a space before left parentheses, except in a function call.

{{% callout note %}}

Note: I'm terrible at remembering to do this for `if-else` or `for` loops. I typically never place a space before left parentheses, but it is supposed to be good practice. Just remember to be consistent whatever approach you choose.

{{% /callout %}}

```r
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
plot(x, y)

# Bad
if(debug)do(x)
plot (x, y)
```

Do not place spaces around code in parentheses or square brackets (unless thereâ€™s a comma, in which case see above).

```r
# Good
if (debug) do(x)
penguins[5, ]

# Bad
if ( debug ) do(x)  # No spaces around debug
x[1,]   # Needs a space after the comma
x[1 ,]  # Space goes after comma not before
```

### Curly braces

An opening curly brace should never go on its own line and should always be followed by a new line. A closing curly brace should always go on its own line, unless it's followed by else.

Always indent the code inside curly braces.

```r
# Good

if (y < 0 && debug) {
  message("Y is negative")
}

if (y == 0) {
  log(x)
} else {
  y ^ x
}

# Bad

if (y < 0 && debug)
message("Y is negative")

if (y == 0) {
log(x)
} else { y ^ x }
```

It's ok to leave very short statements on the same line:

```r
if (y < 0 && debug) message("Y is negative")
```

### Line length

Strive to limit your code to 80 characters per line. This fits comfortably on a printed page with a reasonably sized font. For instance, if I wanted to convert the `chief` column to a [factor](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/factors.html) for building a faceted graph:

```r
# Good
scdbv <- mutate(scdbv,
                chief = factor(chief, levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth",
                                                 "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase",
                                                 "Waite", "Fuller", "White",
                                                 "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone",
                                                 "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger",
                                                 "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))

# Bad
scdbv <- mutate(scdbv, chief = factor(chief, levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth", "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase", "Waite", "Fuller", "White", "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone", "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger", "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))
```

### Indentation

When indenting your code, use two spaces. Never use tabs or mix tabs and spaces.

{{% callout note %}}

By default, RStudio automatically converts tabs to two spaces in your code. So if you use the tab button in R Studio, you're good to go.

{{% /callout %}}

!["Insert spaces for tab" setting in RStudio](/img/tab_indent.png)

The only exception is if a function definition runs over multiple lines. In that case, indent the second line to where the definition starts:

```r
# pure function
long_function_name <- function(a = "a long argument", 
                               b = "another argument",
                               c = "another long argument") {
  # As usual code is indented by two spaces.
}

# in a mutate() function
scdbv <- scdbv %>%
  mutate(majority = majority - 1,
         chief = factor(chief, levels = c("Jay", "Rutledge", "Ellsworth",
                                          "Marshall", "Taney", "Chase",
                                          "Waite", "Fuller", "White",
                                          "Taft", "Hughes", "Stone",
                                          "Vinson", "Warren", "Burger",
                                          "Rehnquist", "Roberts")))
```

### Assignment

Use `<-`, not `=`, for assignment. Why? Because I said so. [Or read more here](http://stackoverflow.com/a/1742550).

```r
# Good
x <- 5
# Bad
x = 5
```

### Calling functions

If a package is loaded using `library()`, you can directly access functions by referring to the function name. For example, if you want to use the `map()` function from the `purrr` package, you could do the following:

```r
library(purrr)
map()
```

Sometimes different packages use the same name for very different functions. Here, `map()` from the `purrr` package performs iterative operations. However `map()` from the `maps` package allows you to draw maps in R.

By default, if you load packages with functions that share the same name, a direct reference to the function will use the most recently loaded package. So in this code chunk

```r
library(purrr)
library(maps)

map()
```

You would be using `map()` from the `maps` package. To use a function from a specific library, use `::` notation, like this:

```r
library(purrr)
library(maps)

purrr::map()    # use map() from the purrr library
maps::map()     # use map() from the maps library
```

You can also use this notation to access a function from a library that has not been loaded into your R session:

```r
library(purrr)

map()           # use map() from the purrr library
maps::map()     # use map() from the maps library
```

## Comments

Comment your code. Each line of a comment should begin with the comment symbol and a single space: `#`. Comments should explain the why, not the what.

To take advantage of RStudio's [code folding feature](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200484568-Code-Folding-and-Sections), add at least four trailing dashes (-), equal signs (=), or pound signs (#) after the comment text

```r
# Section One ---------------------------------
 
# Section Two =================================
 
### Section Three #############################
```

## Auto-formatting in RStudio

There are two built-in methods of using RStudio to automatically format and clean up your code. They are not perfect, but can help in some circumstances.

## Format code

**Code > Reformat Code** (Shift + Cmd/Ctrl + A)

##### Bad code

```r
# comments are retained
1+1

if(TRUE){
x=1  # inline comments
}else{
x=2;print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')}
1*3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2+2+2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

penguins %>%
filter(island == "Torgersen") %>%
group_by(species) %>%
summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

lm(y~x1+x2, data=data.frame(y=rnorm(100),x1=rnorm(100),x2=rnorm(100)))  ### a linear model

1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1+1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

##### Better code


```r
# comments are retained
1 + 1

if (TRUE) {
x = 1  # inline comments
} else{
x = 2
print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')
}
1 * 3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2 + 2 + 2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

penguins %>%
  filter(island == "Torgersen") %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data.frame(
y = rnorm(100),
x1 = rnorm(100),
x2 = rnorm(100)
))  ### a linear model

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

**Format code** will attempt to adjust the source code formatting to adhere to the style guide specified above. It doesn't look perfect, but is more readable than the original. We should still clean up some of this manually, such as the comment on the last line that flows over.

## Reindent lines

**Code > Reindent Lines** (Cmd/Ctrl + I)

##### Bad code

```r
# comments are retained
1 + 1

if (TRUE) {
x = 1  # inline comments
} else{
x = 2
print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')
}
1 * 3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2 + 2 + 2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

penguins %>%
filter(island == "Torgersen") %>%
group_by(species) %>%
summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data.frame(
y = rnorm(100),
x1 = rnorm(100),
x2 = rnorm(100)
))  ### a linear model

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +
1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

##### Better code


```r
# comments are retained
1 + 1

if (TRUE) {
  x = 1  # inline comments
} else{
  x = 2
  print('Oh no... ask the right bracket to go away!')
}
1 * 3 # one space before this comment will become two!
2 + 2 + 2    # only 'single quotes' are allowed in comments

penguins %>%
  filter(island == "Torgersen") %>%
  group_by(species) %>%
  summarize(body_mass = mean(body_mass_g, na.rm = TRUE))

lm(y ~ x1 + x2, data = data.frame(
  y = rnorm(100),
  x1 = rnorm(100),
  x2 = rnorm(100)
))  ### a linear model

1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1 +
  1 + 1 + 1 + 1 + 1  ## comments after a long line
## here is a long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long long comment
```

**Reindent lines** will add spacing to conditional expression blocks, multi-line functions, expressions which run over multiple lines, and piped operations. Again, it is not perfect but it does some of the formatting work for us.

## `styler`

[`styler`](http://styler.r-lib.org/) is a package that auto-formats R source code to adhere to the `tidyverse` formatting rules. You can re-style a snippet of code, an entire `.R/.Rmd` file, or a directory of `.R/.Rmd` files.

See [the introduction](http://styler.r-lib.org/articles/introducing_styler.html) for examples of how to re-format code using this package.

## Exercise: style this code

Here's a chunk of code from an exercise from a different class. It is formatted terribly, but as you can see it does work - the computer can interpret it. Use the style guide to clean it up and make it readable.
