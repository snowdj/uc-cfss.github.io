```{r setup, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache = TRUE)
```

```{r packages, cache = FALSE, message = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(forcats)

library(wbstats)

library(tidytext)
library(viridis)

```

There are many ways to obtain data from the Internet. Four major categories are:

* **click-and-download** on the internet as a "flat" file, such as .csv, .xls
* **install-and-play** an API for which someone has written a handy R package
* **API-query** published with an unwrapped API
* **Scraping** implicit in an html website

## Click-and-Download

In the simplest case, the data you need is already on the internet in a tabular format. There are a couple of strategies here:

* Use `read.csv` or `readr::read_csv` to read the data straight into R
* Use the `downloader` package or `curl` from the shell to download the file and store a local copy, then use `read_csv` or something similar to read the data into R
    * Even if the file disappears from the internet, you have a local copy cached

Even in this instance, files may need cleaning and transformation when you bring them into R.

## Data supplied on the web - APIs

Many times, the data that you want is not already organized into one or a few tables that you can read directly into R. More frequently, you find this data is given in the form of an API. **A**pplication **P**rogramming **I**nterfaces (APIs) are descriptions of the kind of requests that can be made of a certain piece of software, and descriptions of the kind of answers that are returned. Many sources of data - databases, websites, services - have made all (or part) of their data available via APIs over the internet. Computer programs ("clients") can make requests of the server, and the server will respond by sending data (or an error message). This client can be many kinds of other programs or websites, including R running from your laptop.

### Some basic terminology

- **Representational State Transfer** (REST) - these allow us to query databases using URLs, just like you would construct a URL to view a web page.
- **Uniform Resource Location** (URL) - a string of characters that uses the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) and points to a data resource. On the world wide web this is typically a file written in Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). Here, it will return a file containing a subset of a database.
- HTTP methods/verbs
    - **GET**: fetch an existing resource. The URL contains all the necessary information the server needs to locate and return the resource.
    - **POST**: create a new resource. POST requests usually carry a payload that specifies the data for the new resource.
    - **PUT**: update an existing resource. The payload may contain the updated data for the resource.
    - **DELETE**: delete an existing resource.
    - The most common method you will use for an API is GET.

### How Do GET Requests Work? 

#### A Web Browsing Example {-}

As you might suspect from the example above, surfing the web is basically equivalent to sending a bunch of `GET` requests to different servers and asking for different files written in HTML.

Suppose, for instance, you wanted to look something up on Wikipedia. The first step would be to open your web browser and type in `http://www.wikipedia.org`. Once you hit return, you would see the page below.  

![](/img/wikipedia.png)

Several different processes occurred, however, between hitting "return" and the page finally being rendered. In order:

1. The web browser took the entered character string, used the command-line tool "Curl" to write a properly formatted HTTP GET request, and submitted it to the server that hosts the Wikipedia homepage.
1. After receiving this request, the server sent an HTTP response, from which Curl extracted the HTML code for the page (partially shown below).
1. The raw HTML code was parsed and then executed by the web browser, rendering the page as seen in the window.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
wiki <- httr::GET(url = "http://www.wikipedia.org")
body <- httr::content(x = wiki, as = "text")
substr(x = body, start = 1, stop = 1000)
```

#### Web Browsing as a Template for RESTful Database Querying

The process of web browsing described above is a close analogue for the process of database querying via RESTful APIs, with only a few adjustments:

1. While the Curl tool will still be used to send HTML GET requests to the servers hosting our databases of interest, the character string that we supply to Curl must be constructed so that the resulting request can be interpreted and successfully acted upon by the server.  In particular, it is likely that the character string must encode **search terms and/or filtering parameters**, as well as one or more **authentication codes**.  While the terms are often similar across APIs, most are API-specific.

2. Unlike with web browsing, the content of the server's response that is extracted by Curl is unlikely to be HTML code.  Rather, it will likely be **raw text response that can be parsed into one of a few file formats commonly used for data storage**.  The usual suspects include `.csv`, `.xml`, and `.json` files.

3. Whereas the web browser capably parsed and executed the HTML code, **one or more facilities in R, Python, or other programming languages will be necessary for parsing the server response and converting it into a format for local storage** (e.g., matrices, dataframes, databases, lists, etc.).

## Install and play packages

Many common web services and APIs have been "wrapped", i.e. R functions have been written around them which send your query to the server and format the response.

Why do we want this?

* provenance
* reproducible
* updating
* ease
* scaling

## Obtaining World Bank indicators

The [World Bank](https://www.worldbank.org/) contains a rich and detailed set of socioeconomic indicators spanning several decades and dozens of topics. Their data is available for bulk download as CSV files from their [website](https://data.worldbank.org/); you previously practiced [importing and wrangling this data for all countries](/homework/programming/). However as you noted in that assignment, frequently you only need to obtain a handful of indicators or a subset of countries.

To provide more granular access to this information, the World Bank provides a [RESTful API](https://datahelpdesk.worldbank.org/knowledgebase/topics/125589) for querying and obtaining a portion of their database programmatically. The [`wbstats`](http://nset-ornl.github.io/wbstats/) implements this API in R to allow for relatively easy access to the API and return the results in a tidy data frame.

### Finding available data with `wb_cachelist`

`wb_cachelist` contains a snapshot of available countries, indicators, and other relevant information obtainable through the WB API.

```{r wb-cachelist}
library(wbstats)

str(wb_cachelist, max.level = 1)
glimpse(wb_cachelist$countries)
```

### Search available data with `wb_search()`

`wb_search()` searches through the `wb_cachelist$indicators` data frame to find indicators that match the search pattern.^[Alternatively, you can use the [web interface](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator) to determine specific indicators and their IDs.]

```{r wb-search}
wb_search("unemployment")
wb_search("labor force")
wb_search("labor force", fields = "indicator")  # limit search to just the indicator name
```

### Downloading data with `wb_data()`

Once you have the set of indicators you would like to obtain, you can use the `wb_data()` function to generate the API query and download the results. Let's say we want to obtain information on [the percent of females participating in the labor force](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS?view=chart). The indicator ID is `SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS`. We can download the indicator for all countries from 1990-2020 using:

```{r female-labor}
female_labor <- wb_data(
  indicator = "SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS",
  start_date = 1990,
  end_date = 2020
)
female_labor
```

Note the column containing our indicator uses the indicator ID as its name. This is rather unintuitive, so we can adjust it directly in the function.

```{r female-labor-clean}
female_labor <- wb_data(
  indicator = c("fem_lab_part" = "SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS"),
  start_date = 1990,
  end_date = 2020
)
female_labor
```

```{r female-labor-plot, dependson = "female-labor-clean", message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ggplot(data = female_labor, mapping = aes(x = date, y = fem_lab_part)) +
  geom_line(mapping = aes(group = country), alpha = .1) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Labor force participation",
    x = "Year",
    y = "Percent of total labor force which is female",
    caption = "Source: World Bank"
  )
```

By default, `wb_data()` returns queries as data frames in a wide format. So if we request multiple indicators, each indicator will be stored in its own column.

```{r female-educ, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
female_vars <- wb_data(
  indicator = c("fem_lab_part" = "SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS",
                "fem_educ_sec" = "SE.SEC.CUAT.UP.FE.ZS"),
  start_date = 1990,
  end_date = 2020
)

ggplot(data = female_vars, mapping = aes(x = fem_educ_sec, y = fem_lab_part)) +
  geom_point(alpha = .2) +
  geom_smooth() +
  scale_x_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 1)) +
  labs(
    title = "Female labor force participation",
    x = "Percent of females 25+ who completed secondary school",
    y = "Percent of total labor force which is female",
    caption = "Source: World Bank"
  )
```

## Searching geographic info: `geonames`

```{r geonames, message = FALSE}
# install.packages(geonames)
library(geonames)
```

### API authentication

Many APIs require you to register for access. This allows them to track which users are submitting queries and manage demand - if you submit too many queries too quickly, you might be **rate-limited** and your requests de-prioritized or blocked. Always check the API access policy of the web site to determine what these limits are.

There are a few things we need to do to be able to use this package to access the geonames API:

1. Go to [the geonames site](http://www.geonames.org/login/) and register an account. 
2. **Click [here to enable the free web service](http://www.geonames.org/enablefreewebservice)**
3. Tell R your geonames username. You could run the line

``` r 
options(geonamesUsername = "my_user_name")
``` 

in R. However this is insecure. We don't want to risk committing this line and pushing it to our public GitHub page! Instead, you should create a file in the same place as your `.Rproj` file. To do that, run the following command from the R console:

```r
file.edit(here::here(".Rprofile"))
```

{{% callout note %}}

Note: you need to have the [`here`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/here/index.html) package installed for that code to work.

{{% /callout %}}

This will create a special file called `.Rprofile` in the same directory as your `.Rproj` file (assuming you are working in an R project). The file should open automatically in your RStudio script editor. Add

``` r 
options(geonamesUsername = "my_user_name")
``` 

to that file, replacing `my_user_name` with your Geonames username.

#### Important

* Make sure your `.Rprofile` ends with a blank line
* Make sure `.Rprofile` is included in your `.gitignore` file, otherwise it will be synced with Github
* Restart RStudio after modifying `.Rprofile` in order to load any new keys into memory
* Spelling is important when you set the option in your `.Rprofile`
* You can do a similar process for an arbitrary package or key. For example:

```{r rprofile, eval = FALSE}
# in .Rprofile
options("this_is_my_key" = XXXX)

# later, in the R script:
key <- getOption("this_is_my_key")
```

This is a simple means to keep your keys private, especially if you are sharing the same authentication across several projects. Remember that using `.Rprofile` makes your code un-reproducible. In this case, that is exactly what we want!

### Using Geonames

What can we do? Get access to lots of geographical information via the various ["web services"](http://www.geonames.org/export/ws-overview.html)

```{r geonames-country-info}
countryInfo <- GNcountryInfo()
```

```{r geonames-str}
countryInfo %>%
  as_tibble() %>%
  glimpse()
```

This country info dataset is very helpful for accessing the rest of the data, because it gives us the standardized codes for country and language.  

## The Manifesto Project: `manifestoR`

[The Manifesto Project](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/) collects and organizes political party manifestos from around the world. It currently covers over 1000 parties from 1945 until today in over 50 countries on five continents. We can use the [`manifestoR` package](https://github.com/ManifestoProject/manifestoR) to access the API and download those manifestos for analysis in R.

### Load library and set API key

Accessing data from the Manifesto Project API requires an authentication key. You can create an account and key [here](https://manifesto-project.wzb.eu/signup). Here I store my key in `.Rprofile` and retrieve it using `mp_setapikey()`.

```{r manifestor-load, message = FALSE, cache = FALSE}
library(manifestoR)

# retrieve API key stored in .Rprofile
mp_setapikey(key = getOption("manifesto_key"))
```

### Retrieve the database

```{r manifestor-db}
(mpds <- mp_maindataset())
```

`mp_maindataset()` includes a data frame describing each manifesto included in the database. You can use this database for some exploratory data analysis. For instance, how many manifestos have been published by each political party in Sweden?

```{r manifesto-dist}
mpds %>%
  filter(countryname == "Sweden") %>%
  count(partyname) %>%
  ggplot(aes(fct_reorder(partyname, n), n)) +
  geom_col() +
  labs(title = "Political manifestos published in Sweden",
       x = NULL,
       y = "Total (1948-present)") +
  coord_flip()
```

Or we can use **scaling functions** to identify each party manifesto on an ideological dimension. For example, how have the Democratic and Republican Party manifestos in the United States changed over time?

```{r manifestor-usa}
mpds %>%
  filter(party == 61320 | party == 61620) %>%
  mutate(ideo = mp_scale(.)) %>%
  select(partyname, edate, ideo) %>%
  ggplot(aes(edate, ideo, color = partyname)) +
  geom_line() +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("blue", "red")) +
  labs(title = "Ideological scaling of major US political parties",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Ideological position",
       color = NULL) +
  theme(legend.position = "bottom")
```

### Download manifestos

`mp_corpus()` can be used to download the original manifestos as full text documents stored as a [**corpus**](/notes/text-analysis-workflow/#extract-documents-and-move-into-a-corpus). Once you obtain the corpus, you can perform [text analysis](/notes/text-analysis-workflow/). As an example, let's compare the most common words in the Democratic and Republican Party manifestos from the 2016 U.S. presidential election:

```{r manifestor-corpus, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
# download documents
(docs <- mp_corpus(countryname == "United States" & edate > as.Date("2016-01-01")))

# generate wordcloud of most common terms
docs %>%
  tidy() %>%
  mutate(party = factor(party, levels = c(61320, 61620),
                        labels = c("Democratic Party", "Republican Party"))) %>%
  unnest_tokens(word, text) %>%
  anti_join(stop_words) %>%
  count(party, word, sort = TRUE) %>%
  drop_na() %>%
  reshape2::acast(word ~ party, value.var = "n", fill = 0) %>%
  comparison.cloud(max.words = 200)
```

## Census data with `tidycensus`

[`tidycensus`](https://walkerke.github.io/tidycensus/index.html) provides an interface with the US Census Bureau's decennial census and American Community APIs and returns tidy data frames with optional simple feature geometry. These APIs require a free key you can obtain [here](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html). Rather than storing your key in `.Rprofile`, `tidycensus` includes `census_api_key()` which automatically stores your key in `.Renviron`, which is basically a global version of `.Rprofile`. Anything stored in `.Renviron` is automatically loaded anytime you initiate R on your computer, regardless of the project or file location. Once you get your key, load it:

```{r tidycensus}
library(tidycensus)
```

```r
census_api_key("YOUR API KEY GOES HERE", install = TRUE)
```

### Obtaining data

`get_decennial()` allows you to obtain data from the 1990, 2000, and 2010 decennial US censuses. Let's look at the number of individuals of Asian ethnicity by state in 2010:

```{r get-asia}
asia10 <- get_decennial(geography = "state", variables = "P008006", year = 2010)
asia10
```

The result of `get_decennial()` is a tidy data frame with one row per geographic unit-variable.

* `GEOID` - identifier for the geographical unit associated with the row
* `NAME` - descriptive name of the geographical unit
* `variable` - the Census variable encoded in the row
* `value` - the value of the variable for that geographic unit

We can quickly visualize this data frame using `ggplot2`:

```{r plot-asia, dependson = "get-asia", fig.asp = 1}
ggplot(asia10, aes(x = reorder(NAME, value), y = value)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::comma) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Number of residents of Asian ethnicity") +
  coord_flip()
```

Of course this graph is not entirely useful since it is based on the raw frequency of Asian individuals. California is at the top of the list, but it is also the most populous city. Instead, we could normalize this value as a percentage of the entire state population. To do that, we need to retrieve another variable:

```{r asia-total-pop, fig.asp = 1}
asia_pop <- get_decennial(geography = "state",
                          variables = c("P008006", "P008001"),
                          year = 2010) %>%
  spread(variable, value) %>%
  mutate(pct_asia = P008006 / P008001)
asia_pop

ggplot(asia_pop, aes(x = reorder(NAME, pct_asia), y = pct_asia)) +
  geom_point() +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) +
  labs(x = NULL,
       y = "Percent of residents of Asian ethnicity") +
  coord_flip()
```

`get_acs()` retrieves data from the American Community Survey. This survey is administered to a sample of 3 million households on an annual basis, so the data points are estimates characterized by a margin of error. `tidycensus` returns both the original estimate and margin of error. Let's get median household income data from the 2014-2019 ACS for each state.

```{r income-usa}
usa_inc <- get_acs(geography = "state", 
                   variables = c(medincome = "B19013_001"), 
                   year = 2019)
usa_inc
```

Now we return both an `estimate` column for the ACS estimate and `moe` for the margin of error (defaults to 90% confidence interval).

```{r income-usa-plot, fig.asp = 1}
usa_inc %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = reorder(NAME, estimate), y = estimate)) +
  geom_pointrange(aes(ymin = estimate - moe,
                     ymax = estimate + moe),
                  size = .25) +
  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::dollar) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(title = "Household income by state",
    subtitle = "2019 American Community Survey (five-year estimates)",
       x = "",
       y = "ACS estimate (bars represent margin of error)")
```

### Search for variables

`get_acs()` or `get_decennial()` requires knowing the variable ID, of which there are thousands. `load_variables()` downloads a list of variable IDs and labels for a given Census or ACS and dataset. You can then use `View()` to interactively browse through and filter for variables in RStudio.

### Drawing maps

`tidycensus` also can return [simple feature geometry](/notes/simple-features/) for geographic units along with variables from the decennial Census or ACS, which can then be [visualized using `geom_sf()`.](/notes/vector-maps/) Let's look at median household income by Census tracts from the 2014-2019 ACS in Loudoun County, Virginia:

```{r loudoun-sf, message = FALSE, results = "hide"}
loudoun <- get_acs(state = "VA",
                   county = "Loudoun",
                   geography = "tract", 
                   variables = c(medincome = "B19013_001"), 
                   year = 2019,
                   geometry = TRUE)
```

```{r loudoun-sf-print, dependson = "loudoun-sf"}
loudoun
```

This looks similar to the previous output but because we set `geometry = TRUE` it is now a simple features data frame with a `geometry` column defining the geographic feature. We can visualize it using `geom_sf()` and `viridis::scale_*_viridis()` to adjust the color palette.

```{r loudoun-sf-plot, dependson = "loudoun-sf"}
ggplot(data = loudoun) +
  geom_sf(mapping = aes(fill = estimate, color = estimate)) +
  coord_sf(crs = 26911) +
  scale_fill_viridis(
    option = "magma",
    labels = scales::dollar,
    aesthetics = c("fill", "color")
  )
```
