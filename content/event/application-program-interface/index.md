## Overview

* Identify multiple methods for obtaining data from the internet
* Define application program interface (API)
* Explain authentication keys and demonstrate secure methods for storing these keys
* Demonstrate how to use canned packages in R to access APIs
* Practice gathering data from Twitter API using the `rtweet` package in R
* Identify methods for writing functions to interact with APIs
* Define JSON data structure and how to convert them to data frames
* Practice tidying messy JSON data objects using `tidyr`

## Before class

* Read [Getting data from the web: API access](/notes/application-program-interface/)
* Read [Getting data from the web: writing API queries](/notes/write-an-api-function/)

## Class materials

* [Practice getting data from the Twitter API](/notes/twitter-api-practice/)
* [Simplifying lists](/notes/simplify-nested-lists/)

## Additional resources

* [More install-and-play API packages for R](https://github.com/ropensci/webservices)
* [Documentation for `httr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/httr/)
