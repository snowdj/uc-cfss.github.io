## Overview

* Define shapefiles and import spatial data using the `sf` package
* Draw maps using `ggplot2` and `geom_sf()`
* Change coordinate systems
* Generate appropriate color palettes to visualize additional dimensions of data

## Before class

* Read [Importing shapefiles using `sf`](/notes/simple-features/)
* Read [Drawing vector maps with `ggplot2` and `sf`](/notes/vector-maps/)

## Class materials

* [Selecting optimal color palettes](/notes/optimal-color-palettes/)
* [Practice drawing vector maps](/notes/vector-maps-practice/)

* [Mapping data in *The Truthful Art* by Alberto Cairo](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/databases-and-reporting-tools/9780133440492/part-iii-functional/ch10_html) - excellent chapter on designing data maps with lots of examples. Though really the entire book is useful if you do a lot of work with data visualizations of any type. **UChicago authentication required.**

## What you need to do after class

* [Complete the geospatial visualization homework](/homework/geospatial-viz/)
