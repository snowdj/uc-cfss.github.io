## Overview

* Define a minimal reproducible example
* Introduce the `reprex` package
* Practice generating reproducible examples
* Identify common problems with Git and explain how to resolve these problems

## Before class

## Class materials

* [Generating a reproducible example](/notes/reproducible-examples/)
* [Recovering from common Git predicaments](/notes/common-git-problems/)

## Additional resources

* [`reprex`](https://reprex.tidyverse.org/)
* [`datapasta`](https://milesmcbain.github.io/datapasta/)

## What you need to do after class

* Complete the [generating reproducible research homework assignment](/homework/reproducible-research/)
* Install the `titanic` package using the command `install.packages("titanic")`. We will be using this package in-class next time
