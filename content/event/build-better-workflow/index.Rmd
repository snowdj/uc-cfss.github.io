## Overview

* Identify the importance of preprocessing data sets
* Introduce the `recipes` package for preprocessing data
* Utilize `usemodels` to automatically construct code templates for common model types
* Construct workflows for machine learning

## Before class

* Read [Preprocess your data](/notes/preprocess/)
* Read [Tune model parameters](/notes/tune-models/)

This is not a math/stats class. In class we will **briefly** summarize how these methods work and spend the bulk of our time on estimating and interpreting these models. That said, you should have some understanding of the mathematical underpinnings of statistical learning methods prior to implementing them yourselves. See below for some recommended readings:

* Chapter 5 in [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7)
* Chapters 2-3 in [*Hands-On Machine Learning with R*](https://bradleyboehmke.github.io/HOML/)
* [*Feature Engineering and Selection: A Practical Approach for Predictive Models*](http://www.feat.engineering/)
