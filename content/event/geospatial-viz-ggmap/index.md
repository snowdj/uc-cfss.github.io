## Overview

* Introduce the major components of a geospatial visualization
* Identify how to draw raster maps using `ggmaps` and `get_map()`
* Practice generating raster maps

## Before class

* Read [Introduction to geospatial visualization](/notes/intro-geospatial-viz/)
* Read [Drawing raster maps with `ggmap`](/notes/raster-maps-with-ggmap/)

## Class materials

* [Practice drawing raster maps](/notes/raster-maps-practice/)

* [Mapping data in *The Truthful Art* by Alberto Cairo](https://uchicago.ares.atlas-sys.com/ares/ares.dll?SessionID=A103809140M&Action=10&Type=10&Value=696335) - excellent chapter on designing data maps with lots of examples. Though really the entire book is useful if you do a lot of work with data visualizations of any type. **UChicago authentication required.**

## Additional resources

* [Learn Spatial Analysis](https://spatialanalysis.github.io/) - tutorials and workshops conducted by the Center for Spatial Data Science at the University of Chicago. Lots of materials developed using R.

## What you need to do after class

* [Obtain an API key](https://api.census.gov/data/key_signup.html) and [store it securely](/notes/application-program-interface/#census-data-with-tidycensus) on your computer. We will be using `tidycensus` next class, so you will save time if you set this up in advance.
