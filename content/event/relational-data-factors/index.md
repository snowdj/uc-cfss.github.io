## Overview

* Introduce relational data
* Demonstrate how tables can be linked to one another
* Demonstrate methods in `dplyr` for linking and merging related tables
* Practice joining tables
* Define factors
* Demonstrate how to transform and reorder factors for visualizations
* Practice transforming factors

## Before class

## Class materials

* [Relational data: a quick review](/notes/relational-data/)
* [Practice using relational data](/notes/relational-data-exercise/)
* [Practice transforming and visualizing factors](/notes/factors-exercise/)

## What you need to do after class

* [Complete the wrangling and visualizing data homework](/homework/wrangle-data/)
