## Overview

* Introduce supervised text classification
* Implement a `tidymodels` workflow using text features
* Define topic modeling
* Explain Latent Dirichlet allocation and how this process works
* Demonstrate how to use LDA to recover topic structure from an unknown set of topics
* Identify methods for selecting the appropriate parameter for $k$

## Before class

* Read chapters 5-7 in [*Tidy Text Mining with R*](http://tidytextmining.com/)

## Class materials

* [Text analysis: supervised classification](/notes/supervised-text-classification/)
* [Text analysis: topic modeling](/notes/topic-modeling/)

## To do for Tuesday

* [Complete the text analysis homework](/homework/text-analysis/)
