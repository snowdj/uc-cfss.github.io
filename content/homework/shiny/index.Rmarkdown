# Overview

Due by 1:30pm on Monday July 29th.

# Fork the `hw08` repository

Go [here](https://github.com/cfss-fa19/hw08) to fork the repo.

# What we've done

We created a Shiny app that lets you search through and generate information on city of Chicago wage employees. We used the [`employees-wage.csv`](https://github.com/uc-cfss/shiny-demo) data file and [this code](/notes/shiny/#final-shiny-app-code) for our app.

# What you need to do

## Option A - extend the Chicago employees app

The app is functional, but is also missing a major segment of employees in the city: salaried employees. For the homework, you need to revise the app to incorporate salaried employees and present information relevant to both sets of employees (use the `employees-all.csv` file). Consider drawing inspiration from the city's [employee dashboard](https://data.cityofchicago.org/Administration-Finance/Current-Employee-Names-Salaries-and-Position-Title/aned-ke5c). Potential features could be (but are not limited to):

* Separate filters for salaries and hourly wages
* Tabset layouts
* Use the `DT` package to present an employee-level table of results in an interative table.
* Visually improve the appearance of the plots (adjust the themes, color palettes, add labels, etc.)
* Show the number of results found whenever the filters change. For example, when searching for employees in the department of finance, the app would show the text "We found 560 employees matching these criteria"
* Experiment with packages that add extra features to Shiny, such as `shinyjs`, `leaflet`, `shinydashboard`, `shinythemes`, `ggvis`
* Implement the app using a `flexdashboard` format
* If you know CSS, add CSS to make your app look nicer
* Allow the user to download the results table as a .csv file

## Option B - create a new Shiny app

This app can use an entirely different dataset. Perhaps write an app to explore the `gapminder` dataset, or use your own data set (maybe you collected it for another assignment). The sky is the limit here, so be creative! Or be simple to minimize your workload over the next week. But the more creative your effort, the more points awarded.

## Expectations for your app

Regardless of which option you select, you **must** do the following things:

1. Your app should be deployed online on [shinyapps.io](http://www.shinyapps.io). Make sure your app actually works online (sometimes your app will work in RStudio but will have errors on shinyapps.io - make sure you deploy early and often to make debugging easier).
1. Update the `README.md` file in your homework repo. In it you should describe your app and add a link to the URL where the app is hosted.
1. Include the code for your Shiny app in your repository so we can evaluate it.

# Submit the assignment

Your assignment submission includes two components:

1. A working Shiny app hosted on shinyapps.io
1. A GitHub repo that includes the underlying source code which created the app.

Follow instructions on [homework workflow](/faq/homework-guidelines/#homework-workflow). As part of the pull request, you're encouraged to reflect on what was hard/easy, problems you solved, helpful tutorials you read, etc.

# Rubric

Check minus: The deployed app does not work or results in many errors. There is no `README` file describing what the app does.

Check: Shiny app runs. The `README` file describes either a new app or 3+ additions to our Chicago wage employees app. Whatever is described in the `README` is actually implemented in the app.

Check plus: Amazing Shiny app. Lots of new features or a very cool new app idea. App looks great visually.
