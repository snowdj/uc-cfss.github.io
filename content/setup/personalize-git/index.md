**You only have to do this once per machine.**

In order to track changes and attribute them to the correct user, we need to tell Git your name and email address.

The [`usethis`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/) package includes helpful functions for common setup and development operations in R. Install it by running the command

```r
install.packages("usethis")
```

from the console in RStudio. Then run the following commands:

```r
library(usethis)
use_git_config(user.name = "Benjamin Soltoff", user.email = "ben@bensoltoff.com")
```

Replace `Benjamin Soltoff` and `ben@bensoltoff.com` with your name and email address. Your name could be your GitHub username, or your actual first and last name. **Your email address must be the email address associated with your GitHub account.**
