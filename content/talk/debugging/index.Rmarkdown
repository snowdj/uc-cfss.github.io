* Review best practices for reading, writing, and styling code
* Distinguish between errors, warnings, and messages
* Introduce `traceback()` and explain how to read it
* Identify and practice methods for error handling and recovery

* Read [**Debugging, condition handling, and defensive programming** in *Advanced R*](http://adv-r.had.co.nz/Exceptions-Debugging.html)
* Skim/read [The `tidyverse` style guide](http://style.tidyverse.org/)
* Review [21.6 Dealing with failure in *R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/iteration.html#dealing-with-failure)

## Class materials

* [Bugs and styling code](/notes/style-guide/)
