## Overview

* Identify the importance of graphics in communicating information
* Define the layered grammar of graphics
* Demonstrate how to use layered grammar of graphics to build Minard's graph of Napoleon's invasion of Russia
* Practice generating layered graphics using [`ggplot2`](https://github.com/hadley/ggplot2)

## Before class

* Read chapters 1-4 from [R for Data Science](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/)
    * Chapters 1, 2, and 4 are very short but set the stage for the next few weeks
    * Chapter 3 is crucial - you need to read this chapter and complete some of the exercises before coming to class. Exercise solutions can be found [here](https://jrnold.github.io/r4ds-exercise-solutions/).
* Read [The grammar of graphics](/notes/grammar-of-graphics/)
    * If you have additional time, also read/skim [A Layered Grammar of Graphics](http://www-tandfonline-com.proxy.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1198/jcgs.2009.07098)
* [Install and setup software](/setup/)
    * Definitely have R and RStudio installed and operational for class today
    * If you haven't gotten GitHub setup yet, that's fine but you will need it to complete [homework 1](/homework/edit-readme/)

## Class materials

* [Why visualize data?](/notes/why-visualize-data/)
* [How to build a complicated, layered graphic](/notes/minard/)
* Practice generating layered graphics using `ggplot2`
    
    Run the below code in your console to download the required files.
    
    ```r
    usethis::use_course("uc-cfss/grammar-of-graphics")
    ```

* [Exploring Minard's 1812 plot with `ggplot2`](https://github.com/andrewheiss/fancy-minard) - a much fancier (and more complex) version

## Additional resources

### Graphical design

* [Tufte, Edward R. *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*.](https://www.edwardtufte.com/tufte/books_vdqi) Classic book on statistical graphics and visualization design.
* [Healey, Kieran. *Data Visualization: A Practical Guide*.](https://socviz.co/) An applied introduction to graphical design with lots of applications in `ggplot2` (and many code examples).

### `ggplot2`

* [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis, 2nd Edition](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007/978-3-319-24277-4) -- Hadley Wickham. Excellent resource for learning the intricacies of `ggplot2`.
* [Documentation for ggplot2](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/)
* [R Graphics Cookbook, 2nd edition](https://r-graphics.org/) -- Winston Chang. A practical guide with 150 examples to generate quality statistical graphics based on the data you wish to present.
* Why do we learn the `ggplot2` graphics library and not the base [`graphics`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/views/Graphics.html) system? David Robinson explains it well in [Don't teach built-in plotting to beginners (teach ggplot2)](http://varianceexplained.org/r/teach_ggplot2_to_beginners/), and follows up with a longer defense of `ggplot2` in [Why I use ggplot2](http://varianceexplained.org/r/why-I-use-ggplot2/)

### Useful cheatsheets

* [Data visualization with ggplot2 cheat sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/03/ggplot2-cheatsheet.pdf)
* [RStudio IDE Cheat Sheet](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) - if you don't know what all the buttons and panels do in RStudio, this is a great decoder

## What you need to do

* [Register your GitHub username for the course](https://forms.gle/6YDKXHpEGPkc9sX28) - all remaining homework assignments will be in **private repositories**. Private repos can only be seen and edited by members of our [course organization](https://github.com/uc-cfss). Once you register your GitHub account, I will invite you to join the course organization. If you don't register your account, you won't have access to any of the homework assignments.
* [Complete the first homework assignment](/homework/edit-readme/)
* Install the [`rcfss`](https://github.com/uc-cfss/rcfss) library from GitHub. To install the package, run the command `devtools::install_github("uc-cfss/rcfss")` in the console. We will be using data from this package in class next week.

> If you do not already have the `devtools` library installed, you will get an error. Go back and install this first using `install.packages("devtools")`, then run `devtools::install_github("uc-cfss/rcfss")` in the console.
