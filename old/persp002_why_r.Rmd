Why would you want to learn R?

# Popular

R is widely used in the physical and social sciences, [as well as in government, non-profits, and the private sector](http://spectrum.ieee.org/static/interactive-the-top-programming-languages-2016).

Many developers and social scientists write programs in R. As a result, there is also a large support community available to help troubleshoot problematic code. As seen in the Redmonk programming language rankings (which compare languages' appearances on Github [usage] and StackOverflow [support]), R appears near the top of both rankings.

# Things R does well

* Statistical analysis - R was written by statisticians, so it is designed first and foremost as a language for statistical analysis.
* Data visualization - while the base R `graphics` package is comprehensive and powerful, additional libraries such as [`ggplot2`](http://docs.ggplot2.org/current/) and [`lattice`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/lattice/index.html) make R the go-to language for power data visualization approaches.
    * Python has adequate packages such as `matplotlib` and `seaborn` (and even an implementation of `ggplot2`), but I don't think they are as robust or user-friendly as `ggplot2` for R
    * `ggplot2` also adheres to a consistent [grammar](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html#the-layered-grammar-of-graphics) for graph construction. A **grammar of graphics** is a grammar used to describe and create a wide range of statistical graphics.^[[Wilkinson, Leland. (2005). *The Grammar of Graphics*. (UChicago authentication required)](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F0-387-28695-0)] The **layered grammar of graphics** approach is implemented in [`ggplot2`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ggplot2/index.html), and once you get the basics I think it is very easy to quickly generate clean and interpretable graphs.

# Things R does not do as well

* Speed - while by no means a slug, R is not written to be a fast, speedy language. Depending on the complexity of the task and the size of your data, you may find R taking a long time to execute your program.

# Why are we not using Python?

[![](images/xkcd_python.png)](https://xkcd.com/353/)

Python was developed in the 1990s as a general-purpose programming language. It [emphasizes simplicity over complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zen_of_Python) in both its syntax and core functions. As a result, code written in Python is (relatively) easy to read and follow as compared to more complex languages like Perl or Java. As you can see in the above references, Python is just as, if not more, popular than R. It does many things well, like R, but is perhaps better in some aspects:

* General computation - since Python is a general computational language, it is more versatile at non-statistical tasks and is a bit more popular outside the statistics community.
* Speed - because it is a general computing language, Python is optimized to be fast (assuming you write your code optimally). As your data becomes larger or more complex, you might find Python to be faster than R for your analytical needs.
* Workflow - since Python is a general-purpose language, you can build entire applications using it. R, not so much.

That said, there are also things it does not do as well as R:

* Visualizations - visual graphics libraries in Python are increasing in number and quality (see [`matplotlib`](http://matplotlib.org/), [`pygal`](http://www.pygal.org/en/stable/), and [`seaborn`](https://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/)), but are still behind R in terms of comprehensiveness and ease of use. Of course, once you wish to create interactive and advanced information visualizations, you can also used more specialized software such as [Tableau](http://www.tableau.com/) or [D3](https://d3js.org/).
* Add-on libraries - previously Python was criticized for its lack of libraries to perform statistical analysis and data manipulation, especially relative to the plethora of libraries for R. In recent years Python has begun to catch up with libraries for scientific computing ([`numpy`](http://www.numpy.org/)), data analysis ([`pandas`](http://pandas.pydata.org/)), and machine learning ([`scikit-learn`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)). In fact, `scikit-learn` is fast becoming the standard for machine learning in the physical sciences and industry.

However, R is still widely used in statistics and the social sciences, and is still used in many government and industry settings. Now that you have a working knowledge of Python, many of the core programming principles will translate well into R.

# Resources for learning R

* [*R for Data Science*](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/) -- Garrett Grolemund and Hadley Wickham. This is an open-source book from the developer of many important packages for data importatation, transformation, modeling, visualization, and communication. It is a fast-paced introduction to the data science workflow in R and quickly gets you exploring, wrangling, and modeling data, as well as teaching you elemental programming skills. Much of this will be quite familiar coming from Python, but it will delve into the unique syntax of R and some of its specialized packages.
* [*An Introduction to Statistical Learning*](http://link.springer.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/10.1007%2F978-1-4614-7138-7) -- James, G., Witten, D., Hastie, T., & Tibshirani, R. Each chapter includes labs which demonstrate how to implement each of the methods. Unfortunately their labs use a lot of base R functions and syntax, whereas I will demonstrate how to implement these methods using the [`tidyverse`](http://tidyverse.org/) philosophy and collection of R packages, however they are certainly sufficient to get started.
* [Computing for the Social Sciences](http://cfss.uchicago.edu/) -- Benjamin Soltoff. This is the site for MACS 30500 which is taught exclusively in R. All the materials for my course are available online, and include additional exercises and example code for performing different operations in R.
* [RStudio Cheat Sheets](https://www.rstudio.com/resources/cheatsheets/) -- these handy cheat sheets provide quick reference guides for important data science operations such as [importing data](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-import-cheatsheet.pdf), [transforming data](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/source/pdfs/data-transformation-cheatsheet.pdf), and [visualizing data](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/ggplot2-cheatsheet-2.1.pdf), as well as mastering the [RStudio IDE](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/rstudio-IDE-cheatsheet.pdf) and generating [R Markdown documents](https://www.rstudio.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/rmarkdown-cheatsheet-2.0.pdf).

# But I don't wanna!

Not feeling up to learning R? That's fine. If you want to stick to Python, you may. However you will be responsible for implementing the technical details **on your own**. If you go this route, I strongly encourage you to use [*Python Data Science Handbook*](http://proquestcombo.safaribooksonline.com.proxy.uchicago.edu/book/programming/python/9781491912126). This includes a chapter on `scikit-learn` from one of the main developers of the package, and demonstrates how to implement many of the same methods we will cover in the rest of term. For methods not included in the book, [Google](https://www.google.com/) and [StackOverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/) will continue to be your best friends.
