```{r setup, include = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(rcfss)

youth <- gun_deaths %>%
  filter(age <= 65)
```

We have data about `r nrow(gun_deaths)` individuals killed by guns. Only `r nrow(gun_deaths) - nrow(youth)` are older than 65. The distribution of the remainder is shown below:

```{r youth-dist, echo = FALSE}
youth %>% 
  ggplot(aes(age)) + 
  geom_freqpoly(binwidth = 1)
```
